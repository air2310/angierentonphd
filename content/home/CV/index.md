## Experience

#### Postdoctoral Research Fellow
> **Sept 2021 – Jan 2023** \
*Prof Jason Mattingley, Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, Australia*

In this role I designed and executed a research program that investigated the relationship between predictive coding and sustained visual attention, harnessing these findings in a novel neurofeedback protocol that aims to improve performance during sustained visual tasks. 

#### Postdoctoral Research Fellow
> **Aug 2021 – Jan 2023** \
*Dr Steffen Bollmann, School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Australia*

Supported and communicated the development of the open source ‘Neurodesk’ project as part of the Australian Electrophysiological Data Analytics Platform project (see neurodesk.org).

#### EEG Laboratory Manager
> **Jan 2018 – Aug 2021** \
*Prof Jason Mattingley, Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, Australia*
Managed resources across three EEG Laboratories, including training new users, technical support, purchasing and general administration.

#### Research Technician
> **Feb 2016 – Jul 2017** \
*Science of Learning Research Centre, School of Psychology, The University of Queensland, Australia*
Assisted with experimental design, programming and development, data collection (EEG, fNIRS, eye-tracking, physiological measures), data analysis, and technical support with laboratory equipment across several research projects.

#### Research Technician
> **Sept 2015 – Jul 2017** \
*School of Psychology, The University of Queensland*
Assisted with experimental design, programming and development, and data analysis and guided the interpretation of results on a single large project conducted by a multi-disciplinary research team.
