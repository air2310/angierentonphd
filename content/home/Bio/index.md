I am a cognitive neuroscientist interested in using real-time feedback loops to better understand the brain. I completed my PhD in neural engineering in April 2022, during which I investigated how to develop and apply neurofeedback training protocols to elucidate the neural mechanisms of visual perception. I love to take on technically and computationally challenging projects and am passionate about open and reproducible science. When Iâ€™m not in the lab I can usually be found outdoors rock-climbing, or at home doing my best to help out the planet by sewing my own wardrobe from sustainable textiles.
